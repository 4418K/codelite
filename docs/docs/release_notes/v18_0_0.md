## Changes
---

- Windows Installer updated
- CodeLite now uses 2 top level toolbars:
    - Main toolbar, a native one. Placed on the LEFT by default. Thsi can be changed from the `View` menu
    - Generic one for the plugins (placed on the second row)
- All images are loaded from SVG files
- git plugin: by default, disable the "Commit" info in the navigation bar
- File System Workspace: when launching an executable, use terminal
- Source code formatter: added support for `cmake-format` (doc updated for how to install it)
- Registered `CMake` as a language in CodeLite and associate it with the file type `TypeCMake`
- Windows: MSYS2 is now located using the registry entries first
- Aligned wxCrafter version with CodeLite's one
- Updated CodeLite icon
- Rust compiler: collect crate paths (as reported by cargo during the build) to properly open files with errors (these files paths are reported relative to the crate's Cargo.toml file)
- Language Server: do not fire a code completion request when typing inside a comment or string
- Preferences Dialog: Add missing translations (**rlbxku1r**)
- Update `codelite.pot` (**rlbxku1r**)
- Update Japanese translation (**rlbxku1r**)
- Language Server: optimized the chatter between CodeLite and the LSP:
    - Only ask for semantic tokens when the file is loaded or saved
    - Instead of sending the full file content to server each time a reparse is needed, send the incremental diff (`vector<TextDocumentContentChangeEvent>`)
    - moved CodeLite log file location into a separate folder
    - Fixed `LSP::Range` serialisation to JSON
- Language Server:
    - Removed the "priority field"
    - Allow the user to add custom `initializationOptions` (per the spec)
- Dropped support for `RLS` language server (was deprecated in favour of `rust-analyzer`)
- Language Server:
    - Support `cmake-language-server` auto detection (docs updated)
    - fixed: sometimes, the lsp report back with lower case file paths on Windows.

- source code formatter: when a command is not found, disable the formatter by default
- SSH session: allow the user to change the SSH behavior by providing the following 3 environment variables:
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_KEY_EXCHANGE`: Set the key exchange method to be used (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ecdh-sha2-nistp256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_HOSTKEYS`: Set the preferred server host key types (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ssh-rsa,ssh-dss,ecdh-sha2-nistp256`
    - `SSH_OPTIONS_PUBLICKEY_ACCEPTED_TYPES`: Set the preferred public key algorithms to be used for authentication (string, comma-separated list). ex: `ssh-rsa,rsa-sha2-256,ssh-dss,ecdh-sha2-nistp256`

- C++ version required by CodeLite is now C++17
- CodeLite no longer requires `ssh` terminal to execute remote commands. It now uses `ssh_channel` from `libssh`

## Bug fixes
---

- [Subclass of wxSpinCtrl crashes wxCrafter][1]
- Fixed: find in files: exclude patterns are not always working
- wxCrafter: removed the `wxTRANSPARENT_WINDOW` style (it was changed to `0` in wxWidgets, thuse looked like it is always enabled in the UI)
- Language Server: in case the lsp command does not exist, disable it (better than the alternative: crashing CodeLite)
- [latest master build fails with assertion dialog during startup][2]
- [Support horizontal scrolling in the various tree/list controls in CodeLite][3]
- [always use `mkdir -p` (which should be available on platforms)][4]
- Fixed: windows GDI objects leak
- Before opening SSH session, apply the environment variables
- more assertion fixes with debug builds of wxWidgets
