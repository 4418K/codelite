- `codelite-ctags` is now built as part of CodeLite sources and is not provided as a prebuilt binary

## Improvements

### General Improvements

- CodeLite startup time improved
- Windows: `clangd` version bumped to 14
- Windows: CodeLite is now built with `clang-14` toolchain on Windows
- Windows: Installer now uses monolithic build of wxWidgets
- Updated the `Replace` UI to fit the other controls

- Hidden folders are now displayed in the UI using gray text and disabled image
- Remoty workspace tree view: added an option to copy a remote folder path
- File system workspace tree view: the top level folder no longer displays the fullpath, but rather that last dir name
- A modified tab now displays a round circle indicating that the file is modified
- **Windows**: Upgraded to `wxWidgets 3.2`
- **Windows**: CodeLite is now built with `clang`
- All template files have been updated to use the `dap` - [Debug Adapter Client][7] by default
- `Welcome Page` has been updated, mainly, the list of `Recently opened workspaces` now includes list of workspaces opened by other plugins (e.g. `Remoty`)

### Debug Adapter Client

- Since version 16.2.0, we introduced a new plugin: [Debug Adapter Client][7] - an implementation for the [Debug Adapter Protocol][8]. With this plugin, you can now debug, basically, any language.
- CodeLite auto detects and configures `lldb-vscode` (an adapter for the excellent `lldb` debugger) and `debugpy` (python debugger)
- The plugin supports the following views:
    - Call stack
    - Threads
    - Breakpoints (location & function based)
    - Local variables
    - Watches
    - Output pane
    - Module pane
    - Hover tips

### Find in files

- Speed improvement. For example, here is the outupt for searching for `clCommandEvent` in CodeLite sources:

```bash
====== Number of files scanned: 3717, Matches found: 1015, elapsed time: 1.651 seconds ======
```

- UI simplified
- Added option for searching in:
    - Hidden folders (off by default)
    - Follow symbolic links (off by default)

### Themes & Colours

- Added new themes:
    - Tokyo light
    - Tokyo dark
    - Tango dark
    - and others
- `C++` colouring: support colouring variables using a unique colour in addition to the classes, enums, structs etc

### Remoty plugin

- `codelite-remote` configuration lookup has been updated. [See the plugin page doc][2]
- `codelite-remote` added support for environment variables
- You can now edit the remote `codelite-remote.json` configuration file by right clicking on the top level folder of the workspace view
- Support workspace reload
- Remoty workspace view: added the following entries:
    - `Edit codelite-remote.json`
    - `Close workspace`
    - `Reload workspace`
