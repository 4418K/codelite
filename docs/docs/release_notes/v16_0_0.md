## Improvements
---

- Fixed: be more tolerant for language server implementations that do not implement the protocol as is (e.g. rust)
- Added `Rust` syntax highlight
- LSP: support completion item's doc implemented inside `MarkupContent`
- Added **new** `Rust` plugin:
    - Debugger support via `rust-gdb`
    - Project management
    - Code completion via the Language Server Plugin using the `rls` server or the `rust-analyzer` LSP
    - Build output is clickable and allows user to quickly open problematic source files
- Git Commit List dialog: layout changes. Make the diff window occupy half of the dialog
- Windows / macOS: visual updates to the notebook control
- clToolBar: honour the `wxTB_NODIVIDER` style flag
- use a more sensible colours for highligthing text in the various tree / list controls
- Implemented a custom Menu Bar
- Better dark mode support on windows
- General performance & stability fixes
- Added new Remote plugin which allows user to load a remote "File System Workspace" over SSH
- Task view removed. It is now part of the Find In Files dialog
- Colours and fonts dialog: updating the text selection colours is now done for all the languages supported for the currently active theme
- Windows: use codelite-exec to launch program when the 'pause when execution ends' flag is checked in the project settings. This also prints the program exit code
- **Remoty plugin**: use the newly added `codelite-remote` interface which allows using various plugin on a remote machines:
    - `Git`

- Git plugin log view re-written and it now uses the same control as the build output, which honours the terminal colours
- Project Settings: Improve dirty settings detection (rlbxku1r)
- Project Settings: Use `append` by default for PCH flags option (rlbxku1r)
- Various fixes for building CodeLite using MinGW + CMake (Tim Stahlhut)
- Windows and macOS are now built against latest wxWidgets 3.1.6
- `clangd` + `clang-format` that comes with CodeLite for macOS and Windows are now using version `12.0.0`
- File System Workspace: support multi-line commands in the build pages
- When using the file system workspace, export a special enviroment variable `CXX_INCLUDE_PATHS` this variable contains a list of compiler search paths for header files, separated by `;` is useful when using `CMake` + `MinGW` + `file system workspace` under windows, where the `CMAKE_EXPORTS_COMPILE_COMMANDS` does not include the compiler search paths, which breaks `clangd` code completion
- GDB-MI output parser re-written to support custom file paths with unusual characters
- VIM:Add some new commands (`~`, `o`, `O`) (mx)
- When importing themes with true black colour as their background colour, soften the it a bit
- git plugin: better support for remote repository where the workspace is not set in the root folder of the workspace
- change the location of CodeLite temp folder into `/tmp/codelite/PID`. This should reduce the spam under the `/tmp` folder
- Support drawing multiline text in the clTreeCtrl
- Code completion entry tooltip: CodeLite now supports Markdown rendering
