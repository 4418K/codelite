Debug Adapter Client
---

- Allow user to set function breakpoint from the UI
- Handle Module event and print it in the "Output" tab
- Add tooltip support
- Write documentation for this plugin (with an example for how to configure lldb-vscode on MSW / Ubuntu)
- Settings dialog - remove the "scan" button and instead add a "help" button that opens the docs page
- Do the same for the LSP (add link to the docs page)
