Breakpoints management:

- Allow user to set function breakpoint from the UI
- Double click / activating bp should open the relevant source file
- SessionBreakpoints::update_or_insert():
    "changed" event should be more "smart" (only update the fields: verified and path, but don't replace valid path with empty string)
