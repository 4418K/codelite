Breakpoints management:

- Handle breakpoint change event
- Make sure that no duplicate breakpoints are added and no breakpoints without file/name
- Allow user to set function breakpoint from the UI
- Deleting a breakpoint should be reflected in the breakpoint table view
- Double click / activating bp should open the relevant source file
